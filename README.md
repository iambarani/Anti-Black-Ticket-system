# Anti-Black-Ticket-system
This is a Java console-based application designed to reduce the black ticketing problem in movie and sports event ticketing. The system allows an admin to manage events and regular users to book tickets for available shows, ensuring fairness by enforcing ticket limits and preventing bulk bookings.
